- 🌱 I'm currently learning about cloud computing and serverless architecture, as well as exploring new front-end frameworks and libraries.

- 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on projects that are challenging and allow me to learn new things. If you have an idea for a project or just want to chat about programming, don't hesitate to reach out to me!
