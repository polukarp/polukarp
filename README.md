- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm @polukarp! I'm an 18-year-old programmer currently studying at Kazan Federal University. I specialize in using React, TypeScript, and NodeJs for my projects, and I have a strong eye for design.

- ðŸ‘€ I'm interested in web development, user experience design, and building intuitive and functional applications. I'm always looking to learn new technologies and techniques to improve my skills.
